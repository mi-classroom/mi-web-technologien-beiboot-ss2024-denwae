Technical Story: [Bildauswahl erm√∂glichen](https://github.com/mi-classroom/mi-master-wt-beiboot-2024/issues/2)

## Context and Problem Statement

The application needs to be available from the web. Frameworks offer a lot of functionality which can drastically speed up the process.

## Decision Drivers

* Familiarity with technologies
* Learning factor
* Documentation

## Considered Options

* SvelteKit + JavaScript
* SvelteKit + TypeScript
* Angular + TypeScript
* React + JavaScript
* React + TypeScript

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "SvelteKit + JavaScript", because there is already some familiarity with it and a new technology can be learned. Javascript was chosen, because it is better supported by SvelteKit.
More familiarity with Angular, but less of a learning effect.
No familiarity with React.

### Positive Consequences
- Learning new technology

### Negative Consequences
- Slower development times, due to being less familiar with SvelteKit
- No static typing with JavaScript
